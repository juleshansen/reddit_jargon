## Personal Notes
The most active commenters appear to be in AskReddit, which is a subreddit for asking general questions for anything aimed at all of Reddit. This seems to be a good representation of the general language usage of Reddit and a good baseline to remove jargon that is site specific and not subreddit specific.
