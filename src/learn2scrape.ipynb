      "!\nRemember when Barr chuckled on Sixty Minutes and said he wasn‚Äôt worried because the victors write history?\nIf Disingenuous was his middle name it‚Äôd be shortened to Will Dis Barr\nGet fucked Mr. Barr.\nConservatives reaction on the Trump presidency appears to be like a relationship with a cheating partner who everyone knew is cheating on you. Yet when confronted by your family about your cheating spouse, you proclaim, ‚Äúbut she makes me feel sooo good.‚Äù\nGet fucked, Barr-Trump\nI‚Äôm looking forward to the day when the events at Lafayette Square for T**** photo op have daylight - Barr was also involved with that.\nWill there be any repercussions for Trump's 4 years of breaking the law?\nThat's a funny way to spell \"lying weasel\"\nInstead of \"disingenuous\" it should be \"in contempt.\"\nSo many traitors in our gov; fucking unbearable.\nNothing will restore my faith in the U.S. government quite like seeing William Barr face consequences.\n\n^...(and ^Dick ^Cheney, ^but ^I ^think ^that ^ship ^has ^sailed ^already...)\nUntil Trump is in criminal court facing real charges idc\nJust reading this and the mention of the Mueller Report makes me think back to how dark those days were.  But in the midst of this, an academic commission was set forth to study the anatomy and mechanics of a right wing operation that had come to power unexpectedly. The insights from private observations would be amazing to read about some day.  I hope that the study of that dim time in American History that is the Trump Administration benefits and equips an intelligent and moral leadership with a way to avoid them gaining steam, making maneuvers, handling stressors, caving to corruption.\nI hope someone gets severely punished for this.  Clearly abuse of power\nWait, Barr wasn't being genuine with the Mueller report?  \n/s\nWe have always known they are corrupt. Probably traitors. Why does it take so long to jail these criminals?\n‚ÄúAccuses Barr of being disingenuous‚Äù is hilarious to me cause‚Ä¶. Yeah. Yeah no shit.\nDisingenuous?! üòÇ he was as much a criminal as the rest. Remember the dead guy that liked to trade little girls with tRump and died in Barr‚Äôs custody? They all need to be put under the prison.\n>Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington (CREW)\n\nThat's...not....?\nBarr? Disingenuous?  I'm filing that under \"putting it mildly\".\nSo what can come if this? Is this in and of itself obstruction of Justice? Perjury? Or, will nothing come off this? Any lawyer want to share thoughts?\nBarr? Disingenuous? Gosh, I'm shocked!\nBarr is another in a long line of deep state scumbags Trump appointed, pretending not to know better.\nwas there really ever any question about barr being in trumps back pocket?\nI have a feeling this is going to be the worst year of Donny‚Äôs life. Only to be surpassed by next year‚Ä¶\n\"District Judge Reggie Walton said that Barr's early comments about the report were inconsistent with its actual findings.\"\n\nIn other words, Barr lied.\n\nImagine my total lack of surprise.\nDisingenuous. That‚Äôs an interesting way of saying ‚Äúparticipated in a criminal conspiracy‚Äù, huh?\nGreat, now when do Barr, Trump, and all of these top DOJ officials get charged with crimes? \n\nThat‚Äôs when I‚Äôll truly know Garland was the right choice.\nI legit forgot about this guy. Remember Rex Tillerson, too? The waters of the swamp are deep and murky.\nA trump sycophant and staunch republican party man who got the job by writing a letter criticising rhe former AG for following the law being disenguous, I can't believe it!!\nDoes the wind blow?\nI see in Trumps future He will have Court Appointed attorney.\nNo attorney wants to represent a non-payer and useless piece of shit for a client.\nI could be wrong though I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs asshole lawyers that will take the chance for publicity.\nMan, I want the DOJ to roast tRump and Barr. Fucking criminals.\nBarr being indicted for obstruction of justice, and sent to prison, would really, really make my year.\nBarr you are exactly what I thought you were = a lying litle shit in the pocket of the President - What did he promise you?\nSo this is now the Garland DOJ and obviously there's no love lost between the current and former administrations.  Could a smart person please help me understand why Garland it's putting out every crooked document Barr wrote out on public servers for the world to see?\nIs he even in the country anymore? Not a very smart man if he is.\nHis face always looks like he just realized he shit his pants.\nThat poor judge is going to get threats now.\nOoooh. Not \"disingenuous'. However will the sloppy person sleep at night.\nJust want to highlight that this is all down the consistently exceptional work being done by CREW - not in any way affiliated, but just want to  point out that you can support their work here: https://crewnetwork.org/foundation/donate\nCorrupt is more like it. Just this morning I was thinking about Barr and wondering when this lying Fascist slime bag would be thrown in prison.\nHow he is not disBarred yet?\nAnd nothing will come of it. Cheeto is going to get off scot free again and again.\n‚Äúlawsuit filed by the liberal watchdog group Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington (CREW).‚Äù\n\nUh, can we double check that acronym?\nHere we go, get it all out there\nI don‚Äôt think a single politician will ever be enlightened\nWhat happened to the grand jury testimony Barr said would destroy the DoJ so he couldn't release it?\nShit is coming now, haha\nI'm sincerely hoping we're seeing the tipping of the snowball rolling downhill that leads to Barr spending the rest of his life in prison.\nOh sweet justice would be seeing Barr being hauled off to prison.\nWho gets in trouble?.How much time does that person get? What kind of trouble does that person get?\n\"Disingenuous\".....Ya THINK?\nI prefer the term co-conspirator or Accomplice.\nAnd by disingenuous the judges mean Barr‚Äôs a liar.\n\"Disingenuous\" is pretty mild for what Barr perpetrated.\nI have more words than disingenuous. Some of the most evil people in this world are in power in the USA.\nWith all of the Obviously Corrupt Behavior by Barr, I just want to know Why He has Not been Disbarred !\nSo are we about to see Trump charged for obstruction now?  Just because he's no longer president doesn't mean that he can't be charged for crimes that he committed while president.\nThat‚Äôs a funny way to spell felonious\nMy guess, sealed subpoena for Mueller Report from Mueller.  Im guessing Barr has no choice, if he gives the feds a fucked report, they will just cross reference with Muellers receipts.. and nail his ass with more charges.\nStop posting these teaser articles until he‚Äôs in jail\nMan, it‚Äôs been so great not seeing this fucking mess‚Äô picture these last few months\nSo if Barr was \"disningenous\"; what happens then? Is Barr forced to defend his honor through various feats of strength?\n\n  \nI mean I feel like if I did what Barr did, theyd probably find a reason to put me in jail. Just saying.\nDroopy dog got in twouble!!\nThat's like saying the Pope is 'a bit religious'.\nIt was a \"how do we spin this so Trump can claim innocence\" letter.  It was cover from the damning report so he right could scream \"witchhunt\" all the while excusing the right from reading or giving serious consideration to all the facts that were produced by the investigation.\nSo let‚Äôs see it. Also the tax returns. Wtf\nHas anyone offered any kind of solution to the fact that the president currently exists outside the law. With congress being the only check on the president, it basically means they can do anything at this point because a polarized congress is never going to have the votes to prosecute. It might happen with a democratic president, but certainly not a Republican one, as trump clearly demonstrate. So that means the next time a Republican ends up in the Oval Office, they can do whatever they want. Seems like a bit of a problem. \n\nSo where are the dems demanding a change to this?\nWhy is this taking so long? They need to be charged before they both die of obesity and old age.\nSo who goes to jail‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs all that matters!!?\nThrow em in jail\nHahaha disingenuous is one of the most kind words I could use to describe this simpering sack of slime wearing human skin.\nTrump drained the swamp..and then filled it with toxic waste. Thanks Buddy\nBarr groveled to get the job - I wonder if he‚Äôs pleased with how it all turned out.  As the saying goes‚Ä¶.lie with dogs you get up with fleas.\nLook we need to prosecute the criminal cabal that held out country hostage for 4 years.\nDisingenuous is gear one for Republicans.\nA member of the Trump administration is awful?\n\n**I AM SHOCKED**\n\"disingenuous\" ???  That's kind, much kinder than Barr deserves.  Everybody knows he was trump's lap dog and did everything trump ordered him to do.  He wasn't a real AG at all, just a cohort - an important example of trumpian corruption.\nThrow the book at them. Throw the library at them.\nDidn‚Äôt Barr write his letter in a weekend claiming he read the entire Mueller report, analyzed it and wrote a letter of historic per portions all on his own?\nEpstein-Barr Syndrome\nI knew there was a reason why Trump's DOJ redacted the hell out of everything.\nThe fish stinks from the head down.\nLol... they really did jot think they would lose. Fuck you Barr\n*Some day, all the Trump illegal doings will come out. Then and only then will America be America again.*\nGreat. \n\nNow let's hear more about Stephen Paddock.\nWhat does it all mean? What‚Äôs going to happen?\nThe moral arc of the universe is long and bends very little‚Ä¶ but it bends towards justice.\nHope they ALL get prosecuted\nYou mean, like....lacking candor?\n\nNoooo, couldn't be. Not Honest Billy.\n\"Disingenuous\" is Republican speak for \"lying.\"\nMy justice hard-on,  just got harder.\nIs this legalese for 'god-damned traitorous liar who enabled a wannabe dictator'?\nTick tock, tick tock. The house of cards are beginning to crumble.\nThis is absolutely absurd. People should be sanctioned for this and disciplined.\nBarr, as a lying, sycophantic, frumpist, might be the very worst thing to come from that administration... and that's saying a LOT!  \n\nI hear he's thinking of running for president in '24.  I hope he does so all the shit he did is exposed.\nThe walls are closing in, 2021 edition.\nSo can trump still be charged with a crime?\nWill this amount to anything? All of these \"new evidence Trump and his cronies are corrupt\" articles that don't ever seem to result in any consequences have given me a serious case of justice blue balls.\nPerfect time for this news to break. \n\nJust kidding. Apparently nobody cares anymore. Trump isn‚Äôt president. So gear up for a bunch of news we should have known while he was president.\nNothing will happen.\nDisingenuous?  That‚Äôs an understatement.\nA professional politician being disingenuous? This doesn‚Äôt seem possible\nI hope everyone understands that we have to have this process. Nothing should be easy to hand over. Lawyers on both sides should  make the other side work for it. Why? Because if it was easy, the GOP would be collecting all sorts of stuff and weaponize it. They'd pick through the information and tailor new information. \n\nExchange of information is how society works. Telling someone you love them is information. Telling someone you love them but don't  is still information, but incorrect information. A lie is information. The information is the  person lies. \n\nWe've received enough information from the GOP to know they can't be trusted. That's the information. The GOP can't be trusted. Now, what is this new administration going to do with this information?\nBarr should change his name to Buffet\n[deleted]\nMy eyes have been hurting so much today I can't even comprehend-- is anyone willing to explain to me like I am five wtf is being decided?\nWhomp whomp\nLet‚Äôs call a liar a liar, please\nI wish I had $100 for every time I wrote the words, \"Are we surprised?\" under one of these supposed revelations about the Trump Admin. doing something shady or downright illegal to protect Donny...\n\"disingenuous\"\n\nJust call it for what it is - deceit, deceit to cover corruption\nDuh u think he was just disingenuous, how about a puppet\nThat‚Äôs a big word for lying.\n>accuses Barr of being \"[disingenuous](https://www.vhv.rs/dpng/d/30-306682_meme-you-dont-say-hd-png-download.png)\"\nWell I hope you get the memo!\nWho is arguing for Barr‚Äôs DOJ at this point?\nAnd a 12-week-old bull dog pup\nSeriously one of my dungeon crawls.\nI‚Äôm shocked‚Ä¶\nColor me shocked. How could he. /s\nPlanning*\nThe opening paragraph is poorly written and confusing. It says the judge ordered the AG to \"release a March 2019 legal memo clearing former [President Trump](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump)¬†of potential obstruction of justice charges...\"   This could easily be misinterpreted that there is a suppressed memo that, in fact, clears Trump.  If someone stopped after the first paragraph or two, as busy people often do, they would be left with an impression that is the opposite of what the intent of the article is.\n\nIt should say that a legal memo \"purportedly clearing\" Trump or a legal memo regarding \"Barr's improper efforts to clear Trump\", or somesuch.\nI thought that was Good Ol J.R. In the picture\nhttps://youtu.be/KRkzdbnMjCI\nLock them up\nWait, *William* Barr?\n> **accuses Barr of being 'disingenuous'** \n\naudible gasp\nmy answer to headline: who couldve imagined that?\nDoesn‚Äôt matter nothing will happen to him\n/in British soccer fan chant voice:\n\nLOCK EM UP, LOCK EM UP, LOCK EM UP!\nJust means it goes to SCOTUS for appeal.\n\nNothing to see here.\nPoop\nWeird\nI‚Äôm surprised he didn‚Äôt eat it\nWho‚Äôda thunk?\nI accuse the sky of being blue.\nSo what's the legal distinction between disingenuous and perjury?\nWhat‚Äôs the statute of limitations on obstruction of justice?\nTrumps not going away, and this is them dealing with it like they should have on day 1\nhttps://youtu.be/7cdC9xOgAUk\nGenuine question, can the current DOJ release these documents per the judges request?\nApparently if you hire a lawyer to rob a bank for you it‚Äôs protected as attorney client privilege. That‚Äôs what the mob did wrong, they should have just had lawyers as their henchmen.\n\nAny evidence casting reasonable suspension somebody had a lawyer commit a crime for you, whether that‚Äôs extortion, bribery, destruction of evidence, wire fraud, tax evasion, or worse should immediately nullify attorney‚Äôs claims of privacy.\n\nOnly hire lawyers you feel aren‚Äôt going to have their offices raided for working with crooks I suppose.\n\n\n  E\nT.l\nWill he be behind bar ?\nNGL I thought that was Elton John for a second\nYou mean horrible person defence.\nGasp.\nThis douche always looks like a kid who got sent to the corner.\nDisingenuous? That puts it mildly.\nCan't wait for the seals to ork to barr for getting that one Florida congressman  locked up.\nI might even go as far as to say Barr was being VERY disingenuous. Might be a hot take there IDK\nIs this Barr person disingenuous? We don't know. In other news, scientists are claiming water is wet. We don't believe them. More news at 11.\nCouldn't Merrick Garland have ordered  to release the memo thus dropping the case?\nNothing will happen.\nThe only part that of the article that mattered to me is that the decision can be appealed.\n\nIt will be, then that decision will be, then that decision will be, then that... you see where this is going\nAbout time\nHow many years does one get for being disingenuous?\nSo the muller report was not useless like most Trump supporters claim?\nIt‚Äôs time to cross the streams and defeat AG Stay Puft\nWorst AG ever...\nTrump in your minds rent free 24/7\nTrump articles 100+ days after Biden took office are tight!\nBarr is a fat man.  Barr is the son of a fat man.\nAre we digging into political figures because they weren‚Äôt nice to you or hurt your feelings??..Treason on site!\nLet‚Äôs move forward. He‚Äôs gone. This is all like a girlfriend who just can‚Äôt leave her ex alone. Its just weird now.\nWow. More useless truth.\nAre we really going back to this hoax? You know what was disingenuous.. Epstein killed himself\nAmazing how these judges show their bias out in the open now.  Politicization of the Judicial branch is bad news.  Shame what Trump has done to us.\n[removed]\nCan we stop talking about trump\nWhat about Fast and Furious??\nWhat about Hillary and Obama, Russia hoax?\nTrump the king\nThe best economy in 50 years and we shot it in the head.\nThat was an Obama operation and Holder acted like he was Obama's lawyer. No one cared then even after the guns were lost. I'm seeing  a lot of double standards being used in these presidential situations.\nLmao. He‚Äôs out of office and people are still crying about nothing?\nTrump 2024!!! He‚Äôs coming for that ass!\nGetting instant feel good emotions from headlines designed for subscribers to the Democrat party line is dangerous. Be wary of complacency.\nThis is it guys, the walls are closing in.\nCan we just stop the fuss about the previous administration? I've hated the never ending flow of information about the Trump administration. It's tiring and often just plainly stupid. I'd rather say, safe the dirt until a year before the election when it is actually getting more useful if he decides to run again. I need a Trump break.\n\nEdit: I get justice and all of that but seriously, the amount of stupid things Trump has done is out of this world. Like, it's so much that it is even hard to remember what has actually happened in the past 4 years. GOP obviously wants to handle off the situation as quickly as possible. I think we'll have more justice if the GOP stays out of office for another 4 years.\nI love it.  They are so scared he will be back and still intimidated by him they just keep trying to dig something up or make something out of nothing.  Absolutely hilarious.  I'm sure he is sitting in Florida laughing saying wait until 2024 fuckers. I'll be back.\nNobody cares\nThis Judge is a well known liberal activist judge who does a disservice to her position by her bias.  She doesn‚Äôt even pretend to be fair especially when it comes to anything related to Trump.\nMaybe the DOJ should be looking at Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop and China Joe‚Äôs involvement with the pay for okay scheme with foreign governments.. seems much more important\nThe problem is the pretense for the investigation was a hit job designed to add more luggage and unnecessary weight to the Presidential load. It‚Äôs one thing to disagree on policy or what you think is best for the country, but Democrats, the media, and woke corporations wanted him to fail. It really shows the disdain they have for ordinary Americans.\n[removed]\nObama appointed judge does Democrats' bidding\nNobody wants to talk about our life long politician who is spending money our great great great grandchildren will have to pay back but they want to talk about Trump and his staff that have been railroaded from day one. Not to mention Trump and his staff are gone BUT let's keep slinging crap so we don't focus on our real problems! Sheepeople!!\n[deleted]\nSay The Hill. Kek\n[removed]\nHolder said the same thing to congress when they requested all the memos and records regarding the operation which was carried out on Obama's order.\nNobody cares anymore. The media is useless....\nRent free\nSo wait, is Biden/Garland's DOJ still defending this fig leaf memo?\nIs disingenuous now a crime? If so, then I would guess all of DC will be getting hauled off.\n[removed]\nEveryone acted like Barr was Jesus Christ himself when ordered to investigate trump and the collusion. Then when Barr doesnt say what they want to hear hes been, \"paid off by the government\" or \"just another GOP hack\".\nSo is it the Biden justice department arguing to keep this secret now?\nTotal bs\nRead past the headline\nSo I guess their going to bring charges on Hillary and Obama along with the rest of the Criminals that lied to us for 8 years of Obama and the 4 years of lies about trump , They are really pushing our buttons and it‚Äôs going to bite them in the Ass\n"
